# Deckscribe

**A smarter way to build, evolve, and organize your Lorcana decks.**  
Deckscribe helps you break decks into reusable components, experiment freely, and track how your ideas change over time.

## 🧠 What Is Deckscribe?

Deckscribe is a modular deckbuilding system designed for players who:

- **Brew often** and want to track variations
- **Reuse ideas** across multiple decks
- **Evolve lists** without losing earlier versions
- Want to bring **structure** to their deckbuilding process

Instead of building one flat list at a time, Deckscribe introduces a few core concepts:

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

| Concept     | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package** | A reusable set of cards (no quantities). Think of it like an engine, shell, or tech module.  |
| **Deck**    | Built by combining one or more packages and choosing an ink identity.                        |
| **Build**   | A saved version of a deck with explicit card counts. Use builds to snapshot your iterations. |

You can experiment with a new package in multiple decks, track tweaks over time, and revisit old builds to compare.

---

## 🔭 Looking Ahead

Deckscribe is built for **expandability**:

- 💡 **Shared packages**: Once formalized, packages could become a shared vocabulary — “Steel Ramp Shell”, “Ruby Flood Tools”, etc.
- 🧬 **Archetype tooling**: Packages enable automatic tagging, filtering, and even deck clustering.
- 🤝 **Collaborative deckbuilding**: Reuse others' packages, fork builds, remix your way.

The long-term goal is to build a **deckbuilding ecosystem**, not just a tool.

## 🖼️ Example Workflow (Screenshots Coming Soon)

1. Create a **package**:  
   → Add cards that represent an idea (e.g. discard engine, draw core)

2. Create a **deck**:  
   → Import one or more packages and choose your inks

3. Save a **build**:  
   → Add exact counts and snapshot the version you want to test

4. Make changes, save another build, compare

## 👥 Who It's For

- Competitive players tracking meta shifts
- Creators refining archetypes over time
- Teams sharing shell ideas
- Tinkerers who never settle on a “final list”

## ⚙️ Tech Overview

Deckscribe is a local-first tool, currently using:

- Hono (TypeScript) for the backend API
- HTML/JS frontend (no framework)
- Shared types across backend/frontend

Runs on port `1337`.
